1, Spring cloud config server
Problem: The clients seems do not connect and retrieve configuration files from the configuration server
Answer: The dependency setting up is correct, the mistake is that the application name does not match the one used in the files on the server side, 
for example
 happy.learning.gateway application name client side
 happy-learning-gateway.yml properties file name server side
